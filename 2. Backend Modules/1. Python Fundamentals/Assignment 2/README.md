# Python Basics and Control Flow


Problem Statement:
- Write a Python program that calculates and displays the area of a rectangle. Prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle, and calculate the area using appropriate variables and operators.
- Create a Python script that determines whether a given number is even or odd. Prompt the user to enter a number, use control flow (if statements), and display an appropriate message indicating whether the number is even or odd.
- Write a Python program that generates and prints a Fibonacci sequence. Prompt the user to enter the number of terms they want in the sequence and use loops to generate the sequence accordingly.
