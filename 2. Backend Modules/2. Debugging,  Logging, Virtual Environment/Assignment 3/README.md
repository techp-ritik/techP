# Working with Virtual Environments, Pip, and PyPI

Problem Statements:

- Research and understand the concept of virtual environments in Python. Learn how to create and activate a virtual environment using tools like venv or conda.
- Create a new virtual environment for this assignment and activate it.
- Identify a Python library or module from PyPI that you would like to use in your project. For this assignment, let's choose the "requests" library, which is commonly used for making HTTP requests
- Use pip to install the “requests” library into your virtual environment.
- Write a Python program that leverages the installed library to make an API call to a free API available on the internet. You can choose any API that suits your interests or requirements. Here's an example API that gives random todo tasks:

- Document the steps you took to install the library, any issues encountered, and how you resolved them.
- Reflect on the benefits of using virtual environments and package management tools like pip. Discuss how they contribute to better code organization, maintainability, and collaboration.
- Share your program and virtual environment configuration files (e.g., requirements.txt) to demonstrate the successful installation and usage of the library. This ensures that others can recreate your environment and run your program without issues.
