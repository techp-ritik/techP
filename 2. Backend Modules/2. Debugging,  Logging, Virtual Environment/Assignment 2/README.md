# Working with Logging Module

Problem Statement:

- Research and study the logging module in Python. Understand its purpose, features, and usage.
- `code.py` contains Python program that performs a specific task,Implement logging statements at different points in the program to record important information, such as variable values, function calls, or error messagess.
- Configure the logging module to output the log messages to both the console and a log file for the program in `code.py` file. 
- Experiment with different log levels (e.g., debug, info, warning, error) and formatting options.
- Test your program and observe the log messages generated. Analyze the log file and identify any potential issues or areas for improvement in your program.
- Write a short report summarizing your findings. Include the log messages generated, any insights gained from analyzing the logs, and recommendations for using the logging module effectively.
