# Debugging Techniques and Tools

Proble Statement:
- `code.py` file contains a Python program that contains deliberate bugs or errors. These bugs could include syntax errors, logical errors, or runtime errors.
- Use the Python debugger (pdb) to step through the program, identify the bugs, and fix them. Document the bugs you encountered and the steps you took to resolve them.
- Implement at least three different debugging techniques, such as adding print statements, using breakpoints, or using a visual debugger like PyCharm or VS Code. Compare their effectiveness and document your findings.
- Write a short reflection on your experience with debugging. Discuss the challenges you faced, the strategies that worked well for you, and any insights you gained from this assignment.
