# Use Case 1: Ticket Management System


## Objective:
The objective of the use is to build a complete real world application where backend developers can collaborate with frontend developers to complete this application.

## Background:
Our organization relies heavily on a robust and streamlined ticket management system to manage various internal and customer-related tasks efficiently. The current ticket management process lacks essential features and fails to meet our growing demands. We are seeking a skilled developer to design and implement a comprehensive ticket management system that can handle ticket creation, assignment, tracking, categorization, status notifications, and seamless status updates.

## Problem Description:
The objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly and scalable ticket management system to centralize all tasks, issues, and support requests across the organization. The system should provide a smooth workflow for creating, tracking, and resolving tickets, ensuring that all stakeholders are updated promptly and efficiently.

## Key Features and Functionalities:

1. **Ticket Creation:** Develop a user interface that allows authorized users to create new tickets with necessary details, such as title, description, priority, category, and relevant attachments.

2. **Ticket Assignment:** Implement a feature that enables authorized users to assign tickets to specific individuals based on their expertise and workload. Whenever a ticket is assigned to someone he/she should receive notification on slack.

3. **Ticket Time Tracker:** Integrate a time tracking mechanism to record the time spent on each ticket. This will help in tracking ticket resolution times and identifying bottlenecks.

4. **Ticket Categories:** Create a dynamic system for defining and managing ticket categories. Users should be able to choose from a pre-defined list of categories or add new ones as needed.

5. **Ticket Status Notifications:** Set up an automated email notification system that informs stakeholders about ticket status changes, such as ticket creation, assignment, progress updates, and ticket resolution.

6. **Ticket Status Updates:** Implement ticket status options like "In Progress," "To-Do," "Completed," "Pending,", “Blocked” etc., to accurately reflect the current state of each ticket. Users should be able to update the status as the ticket progresses.

7. **Ticket Search and Filtering:** Design a search and filtering functionality to allow users to quickly find specific tickets based on criteria such as title, category, status, creator, assignee, etc.

8. **Ticket Analytics and Reports:** Develop reporting capabilities to generate insightful analytics on ticket status, resolution times, category-wise distribution, and other relevant metrics.

9. **User Roles and Permissions:** Set up a role-based access control system that ensures proper permissions for different user levels (administrators, support agents, managers, etc.).

10. **Scalability and Performance:** Build the system with scalability and performance in mind, ensuring it can handle a growing number of users and tickets without compromising responsiveness.

11. **Data Security and Privacy:** Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.


## User Interface (UI)
Designing the User Interface (UI) for the ticket management system requires a user-friendly and intuitive layout that enables users to efficiently interact with the various functionalities. Here's a description of how the UI should look and work based on the outlined requirements:

1. **Dashboard:**
Upon logging in, users are greeted with a clean and organized dashboard. The dashboard provides an overview of their assigned tickets, open tickets, and recently resolved tickets. Key performance metrics like average resolution time and ticket status distribution may also be displayed here.

2. **Ticket Creation:**
A prominent "Create New Ticket" button is placed on the dashboard and other relevant pages. Clicking on this button opens a ticket creation form. The form includes fields for the ticket title, description, priority, category (selectable from a dropdown or an autocomplete search), and an option to upload attachments.

3. **Ticket Listing:**
Tickets are displayed in a list format on the dashboard or a dedicated "Tickets" page. Each ticket entry shows its title, category, priority, status, and the name of the assignee (if assigned). Users can click on a ticket to view its details or perform actions on it.

4. **Ticket Details:**
Clicking on a ticket in the ticket listing opens a detailed view. The ticket details page displays all the ticket information, including its description, attachments, status, priority, creation date, and last update timestamp. A section for internal notes may be available to support agents.

5. **Ticket Assignment:**
From the ticket details page, authorized users can assign the ticket to themselves or other team members. An "Assign To" dropdown menu allows users to select the appropriate assignee. Additionally, there should be an option to "Unassign" the ticket.

6. **Ticket Status Updates:**
Users can change the ticket status by dragging and dropping a ticket the specific predefined ticket status block. Status changes are logged, and the timestamps are recorded to track ticket progress.

7. **Ticket Time Tracker:**
An integrated timer or timer input field is available to record the time spent on a ticket. Users can start and stop the timer as needed, ensuring accurate tracking of ticket resolution times.

8. **Ticket Categories:**
A dedicated "Categories" section allows administrators to manage ticket categories. It enables adding, editing, and deleting categories as well as setting default categories for ease of ticket creation.

9. **Ticket Search and Filtering:**
A search bar and filtering options are placed prominently on the ticket listing page. Users can search for tickets using keywords, ticket IDs, assignees, categories, or specific date ranges to quickly find the required tickets.

10. **Notifications and Alerts:**
Users receive real-time email notifications for ticket updates, such as assignment, status changes, and comments. These notifications keep stakeholders informed about relevant ticket activities.

11. **User Roles and Permissions:**
Different user roles should be displayed in the user's profile page, along with the permissions associated with those roles. Administrators should have a 'Manage Users' page where they can assign roles and permissions.

12. **User Authentication:**
Screen for User Sign In.

13. **Ticket Analytics and Reports:**
A separate analytics or reporting section provides graphical representations of ticket data, such as resolution times, ticket statuses, category distribution, SLA compliance, and user satisfaction ratings.

14. **Responsive Design:**
The UI should be designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Overall, the UI should be visually appealing, consistent, and intuitive, allowing users to navigate the system with ease and perform tasks efficiently. Regular user testing and feedback collection can help refine and optimize the UI for a better user experience.

### Deliverables:
The developer will be responsible for delivering a fully functional and tested ticket management system meeting the above requirements. Additionally, the developer should provide clear documentation, including user guides and technical documentation, to facilitate smooth system integration and future maintenance.


### Good to have features.
Here are some additional "good to have" features that could further enhance the ticket management system. These are optional features which can be implemented if a developer has time.

1. **Ticket Prioritization:** Implement a priority system (e.g., low, medium, high) that enables users to assign urgency levels to tickets, helping teams focus on critical tasks first.

2. **Ticket Dependencies:** Introduce the ability to link related tickets together, so users can better understand the context and relationships between different tasks.

3. **Ticket Tagging and Mentioning:** Enable users to tag colleagues or stakeholders in ticket comments, facilitating better collaboration and bringing attention to relevant parties.

4. **Ticket Escalation:** Develop an escalation mechanism that automatically elevates critical or unresolved tickets to higher-level support or management for prompt attention with notification to concerned persons.


# Developer Approach
Follow these approach to complete this use case.

## Backend

- First come up with the list of APIs you need to build. What should the APIs look like and what action types should be used. The type of input data it should accept and the expected output of the API. Discuss this with your mentor & get approval on this.
- Design database scheme. Define all the tables you need and the relationships between the tables should be well defined.Discuss this with your mentor & get approval on this.
- Setup your framework. Decide a framework and setup it's file structure required for this project.
