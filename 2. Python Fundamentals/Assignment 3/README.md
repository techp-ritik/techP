# Functions, Modules, and Data Structures

Problem Statement:
- Create a Python function that accepts a string as an argument and counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. Return the count as the output of the function.
- Write a Python program that imports a custom module. The module should contain a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list. Use this function to calculate and display the sum of a given list of numbers.
- Implement a Python program that accepts a sentence as input and converts it into a list of words. Use the split() function and store the words in a list. Then, iterate over the list and display each word in uppercase.
