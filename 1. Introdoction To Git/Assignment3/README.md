# Branching and Merging

Assignment:
- Use the same repo which you have cloned in assignment 2.
- Create a new branch called "feature/your-name-and-em-id" from the main or master branch.
- Create another branch called "bugfix/your-name-and-em-id" from the "feature/your-name-and-em-id" branch.
- Add this line in the feature.txt file by replacing the content - “This feature has no bugs!”.
- Merge the "bugfix" branch into the your feature branch.
- Resolve any merge conflicts that arise during the merge.
- Verify that the changes from both branches are successfully merged.
